RedeFinance

This application was created to help keep track of expenses and give the amount you are able to spend. This was also a personal project that helped me achieve a greater understanding in the MERN stack. The technologies used to create this application include MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Yarn, and Material-UI.

This Application takes the user's income and different rates of expenses then returns the difference of available income to spend.

Future versions this application will include the use of npm package plotly.js to display charts based on categorial spending. This application will also eventually return the user's projected expenses for the upcoming months based off of past spending averages.

My intention with this application is to recreate it in different frameworks including Angular and Vue to expand my knowledge with those frontend frameworks. I also intend to use this application to learn how to use Redux with React.
